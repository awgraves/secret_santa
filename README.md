# Secret Santa Application
This is code I wrote for a frontend coding challenge using Vue.js and VUEX.

The challenge was to create an application that would access the https://randomuser.me API,
pull random user data, then create random gift exchanges between these users.  Each user must give and receive 1 gift.
I could only use javascript (frameworks like Vue were permissible), HTML & CSS.

I wrote all the code in this project from scratch (with the small exception of the flicking Text CSS). The only external library I utilized was jQuery's AJAX module for the API calls.
